This project was part of the "Odin Project" curriculum. The task was to build a function knight_moves that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

    > knight_moves([3,3],[4,3])
    You made it in 3 moves!  Here's your path:
    [3,3]
    [4,5]
    [2,4]
    [4,3]
